    <h1>Owner Info</h1>
    <p>Here's some kind-of-personal info about me. If you didn't mean to click on this page, here's a hyperlink to the homepage: <a href="index.html">Homepage</a> <br>My nickname is Maksy and i'm from Poland. I'd rather not disclose my age. I play games like Minecraft, Roblox and some other great titles like the Portal series and the Half-Life series.<br>I have a homebrewed Wii U. I also have a gaming laptop and a phone from 2020.<br>I always wanted to have a Minecraft server, any kind, and I figured that a box server would be good. Then, with help with some admins (especially <i>ImproperIssues</i> and <i>lightiscool</i>) UntitledBox was born.<br><br>Without you guys, UntitledBox would be a failure.<br>Thank you, all OGs, all players except for hackers, the entire moderation staff. Without you, making UntitledBox a successful server would be impossible.<br><br>I'm also terminated on Roblox for a stupid reason lmfao<br><br><img src="/roblox_ban.png"><br><i>The Roblox ban. I already have a new account, and they denied my appeal.</i></p>
