    <h1>Various Tutorials</h1>
    <p>Well, you clicked on here to view some useless, maybe useful tutorials. Well I got some under my sleeve. Here's a quick homepage shortcut so you don't have to scroll: <a href="index.html">Homepage</a></p>
    <h2>Colored Text + Text Outline + Custom Font in Roblox PLS DONATE</h2>
    <p>You probably saw these people with cool text colors that attract a lot of people... and you want one of these yourself! Luckily, you're in the right place.<br>Here is the code for yellow text with a black outline and a cool font (press Ctrl+Shift+C to view it): <font face="Ubuntu"><stroke color="#000000" thickness="3"><font color="#ffff00">Your text here</font></stroke></font><br>Here is the code for red text with a black outline and without a font (press Ctrl+Shift+C to view it): <font color="#ff0000"><stroke color="#000000" thickness="3">Your text here</font></stroke><br>There are so many combinations to try.
    <h3>Do It Yourself</h3>
    <p>Now let's teach you how to edit the code yourself. Take this text as an example:<br><font face="Ubuntu"><stroke color="#000000" thickness="3"><font color="#00ff00">Sample Text</font></stroke></font><br>First, copy the code to any text editor. I recommend using Notepad++ but you as well might use the built in one.<br><br><b>To change the color</b> you need to edit the <i>font color="#00ff00"</i> part. I recommend using <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=color+picker">this Google result page</a> to help you picking a color.<br>Pick yourself a color and copy the <i>HEX</i> value and paste it to the <i>#00ff00</i> part.<br><br><b>To change the outline color</b> do the same as the <b>To change the color</b> part but instead of modifying <i>font color="#00ff00"</i> modify <i>stroke color="#000000"</i>. I highly recommend using colors like black (#000000) or white (#ffffff), but it's up to you.<br><br><b>To change the font</b> first take a look at <a href="https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/enums/Font">this link</a> for all possible fonts. Then replace the <i>"Ubuntu"</i> part in <i>font face="Ubuntu"</i> with your font name. I recommend using the following fonts:<br><b>SourceSansBold, Cartoon, Highway, Fantasy, Antique, GothamBold, Bangers, Creepster, FredokaOne, LuckiestGuy</b> and <b>Ubuntu</b>.
